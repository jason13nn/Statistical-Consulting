#Statistical Topic: *mtcars*
##Data Description
The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973–74 models).

```{r out.width = "500px", fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}

```

```{r, class.source="bg-danger", class.output="bg-warning", class.source="bg-success"}
#data("mtcars")
#dim(mtcars) #32obs. and 11 vars.
mtcars$vs <- as.factor(mtcars$vs)
mtcars$am <- as.factor(mtcars$am)

head(mtcars)
```

##1. One sample t-test
Suppose we want to test if the mean Miles/(US) gallon was 30. The null and alternative hypothesis was as below,

$\mathbf{H_o: µ=30}$ __vs.__ $\mathbf{H_a: µ \ne 30}$

###Check the assumptions
Before performing the t test, we need to see if the sample satisfied the assumptions.

####1. Normality
To check whether the response variable fits a normal distribution, we can apply **Shapiro-Wilk normality test** to the response variable *mpg*:

```{r, class.source="bg-danger", class.output="bg-warning", class.source="bg-success"}
shapiro.test(mtcars$mpg)
```

Since p=0.1229, thus we do not reject the null hypothesis. That is, we assume the response fits a normal distribution.

####2. Independence of observations
We assume observations were randomly selected.

####3. Homogeneity of variance among groups
We assume the variation within each group is similar across all groups.

###Perform the t test

```{r, class.source="bg-danger", class.output="bg-warning", class.source="bg-success", eval=FALSE}
#T test
t.test(mtcars$mpg, mu = 30)
```

*t: Test statistic from the t-test.

*Df: Degrees of freedom for the independent variable.

*p-value: p-value of the F-test.

###Conclusion

Since p<0.0001, we reject the null hypothesis.
We conclude that the average miles/(US) gallon was not equal to 30.

##2. ANOVA
Suppose we want to see if there was a difference in average Miles/(US) gallon between the type of engine (V-shape and straight).

The null and alternative hypothesis was as below,

$\mathbf{H_o: µ_V=µ_S}$ __vs.__ $\mathbf{H_a: µ_V \ne µ_S}$ 

###Check the assumptions
Similarly, before performing the ANOVA test, we need to see if the sample satisfied the assumptions.

####1. Normality
To check whether the response variable fits a normal distribution, we can make a histogram of the response variable:

```{r, class.source="bg-danger", class.output="bg-warning", class.source="bg-success"}
hist(mtcars$mpg)
```

The response seems did not fit a normal distribution, so we should use a log transform or other methods to make it satisfied the normality assumption. But now we just assume it fits the normality.

####2. Independence of observations
We assume observations were randomly selected.

####3. Homogeneity of variance among groups
We assume the variation within each group is similar across all groups.

###Perform the ANOVA test

```{r, class.source="bg-danger", class.output="bg-warning", class.source="bg-success"}
#one-way ANOVA
mtcars.anova <- aov(mpg ~ vs, data = mtcars)
summary(mtcars.anova)
```

*Df: Degrees of freedom for the independent variable.

*Sum Sq: Sum of square.

*Mean Sq: Mean of the sum of square.

*F-value: Test statistic from the F-test.

*Pr(>F): p-value of the F-test.

###Conclusion

The p-value is less than 0.0001, so we can conclude that the type of engine has a significant impact on the *miles/(US)gallon*.

##3. Regression

Suppose we aimed to find the relationship between **miles/(US) gallon** and **gross horsepower**.

###Check the assumptions
####1. Normality
Same as the previous two tests, we can use the *hist* function to check this assumption.

```{r, class.source="bg-danger", class.output="bg-warning", class.source="bg-success"}
hist(mtcars$mpg)
```

####2. Independence of observations
We assume observations were randomly selected.

####3. Homogeneity of variance among groups
We assume the variation within each group is similar across all groups.

####4. Linearity
The relationship between the independent and dependent variable must be linear. We use the *plot* function to visualize it.

```{r, class.source="bg-danger", class.output="bg-warning", class.source="bg-success"}
plot(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)
```

The relationship looks roughly linear, so we can proceed with the linear model.

###Perform the linear regression

```{r, class.source="bg-danger", class.output="bg-warning", class.source="bg-success"}
mtcars.lm <- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)
summary(mtcars.lm)
```

###Conclusion

We can say that there is a significant negative relationship between **miles/(US) gallon** and **gross horsepower** (p-value < 0.001), with a 0.068-unit decrease in **miles/(US) gallon** for every unit increase in **gross horsepower**.

###Model Comparison

Now, we add **number of forward gears** into the model, to see if it improves the model performance:

```{r, class.source="bg-danger", class.output="bg-warning", class.source="bg-success"}
mtcars.lm2 <- lm(mpg ~ hp + gear, data = mtcars)
summary(mtcars.lm2)
```

|**Model**         | **F** |**Df**|**R^2    **|
|------------------|-------|------|-----------|
| mpg ~ hp         |45.46  |30    |0.6024     |
|------------------|-------|------|-----------|
| mpg ~ hp + wt    |43.79  |29    |0.7513     |

As the result, the model with both gross horsepower and the number of forward gears has a better performance than the original model.

#Other functions in RMarkdown
##1. Changing chunk background color

We can customize the style of code chunks and their text output using the chunk options **class.source** and **class.output**, respectively. 

By default, the HTML output of R Markdown includes the Bootstrap framework, which makes it easy for you to change the appearance of your code and output, because Bootstrap has predefined some CSS classes for backgrounds: "bg-primary", "bg-success", "bg-info", "bg-warning", and "bg-danger".

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#For example
#```{r, class.source="bg-danger", class.output="bg-warning", class.source="bg-success"}
#```
```

##2. Font Color

The Markdown syntax has no built-in method for changing text colors. We can use HTML and LaTeX syntax to change the formatting of words:

For HTML, we can wrap the text in the **<span>** tag and set the color with CSS.  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
<span style="color: red;">text</span>
```

You can add any words in the *text*.

For example:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
Some Markdown text with <span style="color: red;">red is so cool</span>
```

The result:
Some Markdown text with <span style="color: red;">red is so cool</span>

Another example:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
The text can also become <span style="color: orange;">orange</span>, <span style="color: yellow;">yellow</span>,  <span style="color: green;">green</span>, <span style="color: blue;">blue</span>, <span style="color: purple;">purple</span>
```

The text can also become <span style="color: orange;">orange</span>, <span style="color: yellow;">yellow</span>,  <span style="color: green;">green</span>, <span style="color: blue;">blue</span>, <span style="color: purple;">purple</span>
